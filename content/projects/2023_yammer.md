This report analyzes the drop in user engagement observed in Yammer, an
enterprise social networking platform, from late July to late August 2014. I
identified that **long-term mobile users** became disengaged while email
click-through rates dropped from 40% to 30% despite stable open rates (around
30%). I thus provided targeted recommendations for mobile experience
optimization, email content improvement, and enhanced user feedback mechanisms.
