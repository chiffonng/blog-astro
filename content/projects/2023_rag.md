I developed an AI-powersed personal knowledge assistant using LlamaIndex
framework with OpenAI API for RAG architecture. I allowed me to quickly receive
answers and insights from my knowledge base in Obsidian. The project also had
robust data processing pipeline to ingest Obsidian-flavored Markdown content and
PDFs (of textbooks and assignments).
