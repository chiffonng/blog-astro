I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/)
studying Machine Learning & Statistics, while living and
engaging civically in 6 cities ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª as part of its global rotation
program.

I am interested in **making human knowledge work more accessible, productive,
engaging, and collaborative** using natural language processing, human-computer interaction, data science, and learning sciences:

- Low-resource, multilingual, and multicultural adaptation (for accessibility)
- Knowledge management and reasoning across modalities (for accuracy)
- Human-AI bi-alignment (for collaboration)
- Interactive learning at scale (for engagement)

[Knowledge can be broadly defined](./blog/knowledge-diversity),
and so I care about many ways of accessing and
producing knowledge: scientific research, education, human-human and human-AI
conversation and collaboration.
